the directory contains code and code libraries required for the generation of (image and feature-level) raw data. 
the key libraries include PROMISE and S3O. 
PROMISE contains a scheduler and handles the processing of raw microscopy images, incl. the compression into hdf5 objects
S3O is a segmentation toolbox for organoid projections and, together with PROMISE is required to generate the feature-level raw data
