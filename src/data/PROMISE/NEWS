- Added renameTIFF

2018-04-02: Version 0.1.26 (Jan Sauer)
- Updated thumbnail function to truncate outliers rather than scale by them

2018-03-25: Version 0.1.25 (Jan Sauer)
- Bugfix in loadProjection
- Added background correction to loadProjection

2018-02-16: Version 0.1.24 (Jan Sauer)
- Adjusted feature extraction to only perform feature calculation on 
  organoids, NOT clumps and NOT the haralick features without segmentation

2018-02-16: Version 0.1.23 (Jan Sauer)
- Added PROMISEsegmentationOnly

2017-09-26: Version 0.1.22 (Jan Sauer)
- Updated thumbnail function to normalize each channel individually

2017-09-26: Version 0.1.21 (Jan Sauer)
- Updated functions to combine features well features and load features

2017-09-21: Version 0.1.20 (Jan Sauer)
- Fixed feature extraction
    - Function should now run considerably faster
    - Note that the old features are most likely NOT 
      compatible with these new ones anymore

2017-09-13: Version 0.1.19 (Jan Sauer)
- Expanded feature extraction
    - extractOrganoidFeatures() extracts organoid-specific 
      features as well as the global foreground texture 
      features.
    - extractOrganoidFeatures_texture() extracts only the 
      foreground texture features without regard to individual
      organoids.

2017-09-12: Version 0.1.18 (Jan Sauer)
- Added function to combine well features into one file 
  (featureExtration.R --> combineWellFeatures())
- Added helper function to load a library belonging to a plate 
  (loadLibrary.R)
- Added helper function to load features
  (feature_api.R --> loadFeatures())

2017-09-11: Version 0.1.17 (Jan Sauer)
- Added a primitive feature extraction function
    - Does not differentiate between organoids yet

2017-08-01: Version 0.1.16 (Jan Sauer)
- Updated the workflows to include the segmentation thumbnail creation
- Added a dedicated segmentation workflow

2017-07-24: Version 0.1.15 (Jan Sauer)
- Added thumbnail functions for the the DNN segmentation output
- Added segmentation to the workflow(s)
- Added a function to move TIF Diagnostic files out of the incoming directory

2017-06-26: Version 0.1.14 (Jan Sauer)
- Added two sub workflows to only project or to only convert TIF to HDF5
    - workflow.R/PROMISEconversion.R and workflow.R/PROMISEprojection.R

2017-06-21: Version 0.1.13 (Jan Sauer)
- Minor changes to fix bugs
- Added intensity distribution calculation (calcIntensityDistribution) 
  to the workflow

2017-06-16: Version 0.1.12 (Jan Sauer)
- Added checkLogs.R
    > Checks the PBS/Torque logs for errors and creates a shells script
      to remove bad files and rerun those wells

2017-05-05: Version 0.1.11 (Jan Sauer)
- Added feature_api.R
    > Adds three new functions ("get_features_by_compound", 
      "get_features_by_well", "get_all_compounds") as an interface to the 
      feature hdf5 files (currently only tested on "inception" features)

2017-03-14: Version 0.1.10 (Jan Sauer)
- Updated featureExtraction.R to create the image masks slightly differently

2017-02-09: Version 0.1.9 (Jan Sauer)
- Updated thumbnails.R -> thumbnailImages() to be able to handle both
  9-field and 4-field microscope setups.
- Added an extra variable (fields_layout) to watchdogConfig.R/guard.R, which
  indicates how the fields should be arranged in the previews/stitching, e.g.
  fields_layout = c("1", "2", "3", "4") indicates that the fields are 
  arranged as:
        1 | 2
        -----
        4 | 3

2017-02-06: Version 0.1.9 (Jan Sauer)
- Added this changelog
- Updated watchdogConfig.R/guard.R to allow differing excitement and output 
  channels, e.g. instead of image filenames containing "DAPI - DAPI", they 
  can now have the scheme "Green - DAPI", where "Green" is the wavelength 
  descriptor of the exciting laser. This change is only reflected in the
  functional code by a change in 'singleImageFilename()', which determines
  the excitement wavelength by index matching, e.g.
    > channels("Cy3", "FITC", "DAPI")
    > excitementWavelengths("Green", "Blue", "UV")
  will match the values as "Green - Cy3", "Blue - FITC", and "UV - DAPI".
  'singleImageFilename()' must now be called with the configdir as an
  additional argument
