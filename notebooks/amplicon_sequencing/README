This analysis was done using a Snakemake workflow. 
The whole analysis with input and output files is stored in the protected directory B110-Isilon3/valentini/amplicon_analysis
In the current directory one can find only the scripts (called by the Snakemake workflow) and the workflow itself for data protection reasons.

In order to run the workflow please install snakemake and all the programs listed at the top of the file in in the "Programs needed" section.

The "oncoprint_organoid.Rmd" file can be used to recreate the oncoprint independently of the Snakemake workflow.
